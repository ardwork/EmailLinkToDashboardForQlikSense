<h2>Qlik Sense email dashboard link with visible selections</h2>
A simple extension that uses the sendto html command to open the users default mail client with a link to the dashboard and current selections in the body. Hidden fields are not captured only those shown in the selections bar in QS!

This has been cloned from the <a href="http://branch.qlik.com/#!/project/572a2191b19dae70c20cbf96">EmailLinkToDashbaordForQlikSense</a> extension on Branch and simplified so that there are no selections for the user.
